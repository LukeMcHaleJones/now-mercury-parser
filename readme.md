## Mercury URL Parser for Zeit Now

- [Mercury Parser](https://github.com/postlight/mercury-parser) extracts structured information from a URL.
- [Now](https://zeit.co/now) is a really good serverless deployment platform. The free tier will allow 1000 calls per day for $0 per month, no credit card required.

## Guide
1. [Setup Github integration for Now](https://zeit.co/github-setup). This will look for a `now.json` file in your Github repos and deploy to `Now` after a push.
2. Fork this repo to deploy ðŸŽ‰
3. That's it! ðŸ¤¯ `Now` will give you a URL that will look a bit like https://now-mercury-parser.now.sh. So if you want to parse [this](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-48198755) odd story about a speeding pigeon then you would call `https://now-mercury-parser.beyonceknowles.now.sh/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-48198755` and get a response as follows:
